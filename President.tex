Dear Councillors,

Here is a summary of a few things that have come up since the AGM or are
on the horizon.

SOGS/PVP Meeting: On March 5\textsuperscript{th}, the SOGS Executive
will be meeting with Amit Chakma (President \& Vice-Chancellor), John
Capone (Vice-President Research), Jim Weese (Acting Vice-Provost
International), Glen Tigert (University Registrar), Helen Connell
(Associate Vice President Communications), John Doerksen, (Vice-Provost
Academic Programs), and \linebreak representatives from SGPS. Our presentation will
focus on five key points: government relations, graduate student mental
health, graduate student supervisory issues, the Not All the Same
campaign, and the Grad Club renovation. We also look forward to hearing
from these university leaders about how we can collaborate with them to
help serve graduate students better.


Parking: Since the way in which parking permits are sold to graduate
students changed this fall, a number of members have contacted me with
concerns about the price increase that went along with the fee structure
change. While SOGS does not have a say in parking prices in any official
capacity, we do take issues affecting graduate students seriously. As
such, we have been assisting a group of graduate students who have come
to us to ask for help in making their case. The students drafted a
letter, which is included here as an appendix. In addition, the VP
Advocacy and I spoke about the issue on CTV News. Our interview can be
seen here: \url{https://london.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1320531}


Policy Committee: As you can see in their report, as well as the
appendices to the package, the Policy Committee is proposing revisions
to Chapter 3 of our unified Constitution/Bylaws/Policy document, the
Operations Policies.


New Office (MC8): We officially open in our new office (Middlesex
College, Room 8) on March 1\textsuperscript{st}. We'll be showing the
space after Council, so come by and see it!


Wellness Centre: On Friday, February 16\textsuperscript{th}, our Provost
and Vice President (Academic) sent a memorandum to me and the USC
President to inform us that the Board of Governors has approved the
proposed renovation of Thames Hall to build a Wellness Centre. The
Provost expressed disappointment that both SOGS and the USC had rejected
the university's proposal for a financial partnership, but also
excitement that the project will be going forward regardless. To provide
debt capacity for the project, the university will delay other capital
projects, including the Integrated Learning and Innovation Centre.



For a fuller report on this year's projects, see my report in the AGM
package, and as always, feel free to contact me at
